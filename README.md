# BackUpApp
Backup your Imp Folders Automatically

This Java code takes care of taking backup of all the sources you mentioned to the destination of your choice.
It takes input from a HashMap object stored in a file in which key is the source and value is the destination.
To add and delete the sources and destination check my BackUpGUI repository.
